Findings from bot evaluations (ephemeral line CAPTCHA)
- Oracle-assisted baseline bots still pass at moderate rates even with rate limits and behavioural gating.
- Jittered bots fail primarily due to incomplete traces (solver quality issue, not a security win).
- Slow, careful bots (uniform steps, low speed) remain the hardest class to block without harming users.
- This mirrors prior findings that purely behavioural thresholds can be bypassed by careful automation.

Refinement added: curvature-behavior coupling
- New server-side check evaluates whether user motion adapts to path difficulty.
- Path curvature is computed along the polyline; trace samples are split into low- vs high-curvature regions.
- Expected human pattern: higher speed variance and more corrections at high-curvature segments.
- Bot pattern: uniform behavior across straight and curved regions.
- Fail condition: high-curvature variance does not exceed low-curvature variance by a minimum ratio.

Research framing
- The results show naive and noisy bots fail, but careful slow bots survive, consistent with reCAPTCHA v3 bypass literature.
- Curvature-behavior coupling is a second-order signal aimed at intent, not raw speed, reducing false rejects.
